RailFenceEncryption
Overview

RailFenceEncryption is a Python implementation of the Rail Fence Cipher encryption algorithm. This algorithm encodes messages by rearranging characters in a zigzag pattern across multiple "rails." It serves as an introductory example of classical encryption techniques and demonstrates how to manipulate strings and lists in Python.
Features

    Encrypt messages using the Rail Fence Cipher method.
    Clear and concise code structure.
    Easy to understand and modify for educational purposes.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Python 3.x installed on your machine.
    Basic understanding of Python and algorithms.

Installation

    Clone the repository:
